Subtopic: Utilizing Rust's 'concise and predictable syntax' for mitigating system complexity in large-scale applications
Use Case: In my daily work as a software engineer, handling large-scale systems is a daunting task, due to the complex nature of the systems. By utilizing Rust's 'concise and predictable syntax', I've made the system much easier to understand and manipulate. This has not only improved the overall performance of our software but has significantly reduced the time required to debug and maintain it. This approach is particularly useful when integrating Rust with legacy systems, as it enhances readability and performance while ensuring seamless integration.

I want you to expalin to me, a software engineer whose day to day task is to handlee large scale systems, how Rust's concise and predictable syntax can help reduce the complexity in large aplications. Tell me about how rusts syntax avoids verbosity. And how the rust compiler helps enforce strict rules like ownership, borrowing, lifetimes.
