// Employing Rust's Panic Handling Mechanism for System Stability in Performance-Critical Applications

// Use Case

// As an operating system developer, I regularly encounter situations where incorrect behavior or bugs exist in the system. This can lead to unrecoverable system conditions. In these situations, I utilize Rust's panic handling mechanism. This mechanism aborts the process during a panic, preventing the bug's effect from propagating throughout the system. The memory is then cleaned up in an orderly manner, instead of creating a potential security vulnerability or system instability issues. This approach is critical in performance-critical applications where errors can lead to significant system crashes or vulnerabilities.

I am an operating system developer, interested in handling errors in a predictable manner. Whenever a bug or incorrect behaviour happens I would like to abort the process with a panic to prevent the bug from propagating. I believe in the fail fast methodology to quickly identify failures rather than letting them propagate through the system. Give me some tips and help me apply Rust's panic handling mechanism for this.

model A

Models response is great, it follows instructions and gives 5 tips on different methods to apply panics on Rust.

*Accuracy:
-- Although the code provided is correct, in the example 2 best practices are not followed. It uses `catch_unwind` to produce a `Result` and then checks if it is an error to make it panic, it would be a much simpler and easy to understand example if it had just made it panic from the start. 
-- In point 3 we get introduced to `expect` and `unwrap`, but we just get an example on how to use `expect`, it would have been best to provide examples for the two alternatives. 

* Efficiency:
-- The order in which the different methods are presented is wrong, it's better for the user to start with the more simple methods and then iteratively advance to the more complex ones. This is why `expect` and `unwrap` should be presented earlier. 
-- Example 1 could be a bit longer to show how the `panic!` macro could be used in a more complex scenario.

model B
* Presentation
-- The models response is unreadable. The Markdown has been mismanaged and has been mixed with the code snippets, creating a confusing text that is impossible to understand.
-- The first and third code blocks just say "undefined".
-- This cannot reach production.

* Instruction Following
-- Doesn't follow the instructions, in method 2 it talks about how to handle errors with `Result` which is exactly the opposite of what we are looking for.

*Accuracy:
-- Code errors and redundancy, for example in this line ` let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| { panic!("Something went wrong!"); }); ` it concatenates a `panic` with another one.
-- In the last example it propagates the error with a `Result` which goes against the instructions.

* Efficiency:
-- Code repeated and redundant through all the methods showed.

* Executable code:
-- Code is not executable, as it is presented in a way that it's mixed with the Markdown documentation, so a user cannot comprehend what is code and what is not. 


The difference between these two models is too big, Model A is well presented and well formatted, both the Markdown documentation and the examples presented. On the other hand Model B extremely poor in presentation, at the point that you don't know if you are reading Markdown or pieces of code.
