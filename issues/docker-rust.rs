Subtopic: Integration of Rust with Docker for Streamlined Development and Simplified Horizontal Scaling
Use Case: In my daily work as a backend developer, I often leverage the power of Rust in conjunction with Docker for improved horizontal scaling. I create dockerized Rust applications which simplifies both the development and deployment processes, but also allows for easier scaling as dockerized applications can be seamlessly distributed across multiple servers. This approach provides a significant advantage when it comes to handling large traffic spikes, as the load gets balanced efficiently.


As a backend developer, I use Rust for its performance and safety guarantees, and Docker for its portability and deployment simplicity.  I would like to combine these two in order to improve horizontal scaling, and improve the development and deployment processes. 

I want you to give me an example on how to dockerize a Rust application. And in the meanwhile document step by step adding why is dockerizing an app something important in software developement.

Model A
This response is not wrong, but it does contain a lot of unnecessary information and pieces of code that make the reading and understanding more complex.

* Presentation
-- Markdown is correctly used, but it is missing a lot more technical explanations. It would have been much better to have more bullet points about how Docker works than Rust code which provides no useful information.

* Accuracy
-- It's not good whenever an AI model corrects itself and writes the same piece of code twice and this happens here. The `Dockerfile` provided is hard to understand as there are two versions of the same piece of code. The model should be able to understand this and if it finds that there is an error in a previous code provided it should change it. Nevertheless the final `Dockerfile` is correct, and is actually better than the one provided in Model B.
-- The Rust code provided is unnecessary, it only provides visual fog that makes it hard to follow what is actually important of the response. It adds two more steps to the solution when they are not needed. One step is to add dependencies in the `.toml` file to add `actix`, which is not at all a requirement in creating a Docker container for a Rust app. The third step creates a simple Rust web app, this is also not at all useful, just brings confusion.
-- The `actix` crate is incorrectly added to the project, as it is not at all useful. This just adds more unnecessary dependencies.

* Efficiency
-- The models response takes too much time correcting itself and creating unnecessary code snippets and leaves out technical explanations that could have been useful, for instance what the `Dockerfile` does.

Model B

The models response is almost perfect, the theoretical documentation and explanations are great, but the code is a bit messy and can be improved to be more clear. It is well presented, the Markdown is well formatted. 

The code provided should be able to be executed out of the box.

* Accuracy
-- The response doesn't miss any key points, but the code provided in the `Dockerfile` is not 100% correct. For instance, performing just `COPY src/ src/` is not correct, as it can leave stuff that was not in the `src` directory out of the Docker container. It's better to run something like `COPY . .` so as to make sure that nothing is being left behind. 
-- Running cargo run is not recommended for production environments, this is explained in Model A and not done in Model B. It is better to compile the application in the Dockerfile and then run the compiled binary.
-- Something to remark is that the code is really well explained, as asked in the instructions.
