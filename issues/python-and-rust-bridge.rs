Subtopic: Interoperability of Rust and Python for High-throughput Real-time Data Processing
Use Case: In my daily work as a backend developer, I often have to deal with applications where both Rust and Python are used concurrently. Rust's efficient execution and Python's easy-to-use data processing libraries make them a powerful combination for my work in real-time data processing and streaming. I typically use Rust to handle the heavy lifting of ingesting and analyzing large amounts of real-time data due to its speed and safety guarantees while Python, with its expansive libraries like Pandas and NumPy, helps in dealing with data transformation and statistical computations. By bridging Rust and Python together using interoperability libraries like PyO3, I can get the best of both languages and deliver robust, efficient data processing solutions.
