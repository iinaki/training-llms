Model A

Regarding Instruction Following, Accuracy and Efficiency, the response presents a server that uses UDP to communicate, but it runs a single loop making it handle requests sequentially. This means that concurrency is not being used in this example. The server could spawn tasks to handle each client using ` async_std::task::spawn `.

Also the buffer stored in the server struct could be made a mutable variable rather than stored in the struct, as it is re initialized in every iteration.

Other than that, this is a good explanation on how to use UDP to communicate.
